## 📊 Data & Algorithm Details

### Vedic Numerology to Planet Mapping
```
1 = SUN (Surya) - Leadership, vitality, authority
2 = MOON (Chandra) - Emotions, intuition, nurturing
3 = JUPITER (Guru) - Expansion, wisdom, fortune
4 = RAHU (North Node) - Desires, worldly pursuits
5 = MERCURY (Budha) - Communication, intellect
6 = VENUS (Shukra) - Love, beauty, harmony
7 = KETU (South Node) - Spirituality, release
8 = SATURN (Shani) - Discipline, responsibility, time
9 = MARS (Mangal) - Courage, energy, action
```

### Planetary Strength Calculation
```
Strength = (Position Factor × 0.3) + (Dignity Factor × 0.4) + (Temporal Factor × 0.3)

Where:
- Position Factor: How well-placed the planet is (0-100)
- Dignity Factor: Exaltation/Debilitation status (0-100)
- Temporal Factor: Day/night strength, direct/retrograde (0-100)

Range: 0-100 (scaled for visualization)
```

### Strength Zone Classification
- **75-100 (Green)**: Excellent Support - Ideal for action
- **50-75 (Blue)**: Good Support - Favorable conditions
- **25-50 (Orange)**: Weak Support - Proceed cautiously
- **0-25 (Red)**: Poor Support - Avoid critical decisions
