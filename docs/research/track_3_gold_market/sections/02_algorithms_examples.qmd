# Algorithms & Worked Examples

This section formalizes the Vedic + Western astrology indicators used in the gold report.

## Algorithm A: Trading-Day Ephemeris Alignment

1. Load gold trading dates from the local cache.
2. Compute planetary longitudes at **12:00 UTC** for each trading day.
3. Derive retrograde, combustion, sign ingress, and lunar phase indicators.

Implementation: `docs/research/track_3_gold_market/scripts/generate_gold_astro_features.py`

## Algorithm B: Aspect Trigger

For planets $i,j$ and target angle $\theta$:

$$
|(\lambda_i - \lambda_j) \bmod 360 - \theta| \leq \epsilon
$$

We evaluate **all major + minor aspects** across all planet pairs.

## Algorithm C: Event Overlap

Define **event days** as top 5% absolute log-returns. Compute overlap between indicator activation and event windows (±1, ±3, ±7, ±14, ±30 days).
