  This study presents a rigorous quantitative investigation into the temporal relationship between two ancient Vedic predictive systems: Vedic Numerology (Anka Jyotish) and Vedic Astrology (Parashari Jyotish). Despite sharing a common mythological lineage where numbers are mapped to planetary deities, our computational analysis reveals a fundamental temporal discontinuity. Using the Swiss Ephemeris (DE440) for sub-arcsecond precision astronomical calculations, we demonstrate that Numerology operates on a discrete, low-frequency temporal grid (changing ~73 times annually), while Astrology functions as a high-frequency continuous system (Moon changes Nakshatra ~27 times monthly). Mathematical analysis reveals 99.48% orthogonality between the normalized time series, and Nakshatra-Day mapping shows synchronization rates (11.23%) statistically indistinguishable from random chance (11.11%). These findings establish that despite mythological connections, Vedic Numerology and Vedic Astrology should be treated as distinct, non-interchangeable predictive frameworks providing independent information dimensions.
