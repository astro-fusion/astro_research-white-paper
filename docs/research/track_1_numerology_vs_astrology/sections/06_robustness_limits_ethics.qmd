# Robustness Checks

We test sensitivity to time-of-day and location. If numerology were genuinely synchronized with astrology, match rates should remain stable across observation conditions.

# Ethical & Practical Considerations

This study evaluates symbolic systems using quantitative methods. Results should not be used to override medical, legal, or safety-critical decision-making. The objective is **methodological clarity**, not prescriptive or determinist prediction.

# Limitations

*   **Sampling Resolution**: Astrology varies hourly; our daily sampling compresses this variability.
*   **Single-Year Data**: 2024 provides a clean baseline but does not cover multi-year cycles.
*   **Simplified Dignity Checks**: Debilitation logic uses sign-based conditions only; full shadbala would refine this.
*   **Cultural Variants**: Numerology traditions differ (Vedic vs. Pythagorean), which may affect mapping.

# Reproducibility & Availability

*   **Codebase**: All algorithms used in this paper are implemented in the repository under `src/`.
*   **Data Generation**: Daily series are generated programmatically from Swiss Ephemeris.
*   **Reproducibility Target**: Exact replication of 2024 results should be deterministic given identical settings.
