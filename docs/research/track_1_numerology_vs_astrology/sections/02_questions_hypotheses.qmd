## Research Questions & Hypotheses

We formalize the investigation into testable hypotheses:

*   **RQ1**: How often does the numerological ruling planet match the Moon's Nakshatra lord on the same day?
*   **RQ2**: Are any months or seasons more aligned than others?
*   **RQ3**: Do numerology and astrology exhibit similar frequency signatures in the time domain?

**H1 (Null)**: Numerology-astrology alignment occurs at random chance (~11.1%).
**H2 (Alternative)**: Alignment is significantly higher than chance, indicating synchronous operation.
