## 📊 Strength Calculation Formula

### Vedic Astrology (Hourly)

```
Planetary_Strength = (Position_Factor × 0.3) + (Dignity_Factor × 0.4) + (Temporal_Factor × 0.3)
```

**Components:**
- **Position Factor** (0-100): Current position in zodiac
  - Exalted position = 100
  - Debilitated position = 0
  - Intermediate positions scale accordingly

- **Dignity Factor** (0-100): House placement and aspects
  - Own house = 80-100
  - Friend's house = 60-80
  - Neutral house = 40-60
  - Enemy's house = 0-40

- **Temporal Factor** (0-100): Time-based strength
  - Daytime vs nighttime
  - Lunar phase
  - Weekday rulership

**Result Range:** 0-100 (continuous)

### Vedic Numerology (Daily)

```
Mulanka = ((Day_Digit_Sum + Month_Digit_Sum + Year_Digit_Sum - 1) % 9) + 1
Bhagyanka = ((Day_Digit_Sum + Month_Digit_Sum + Year_Digit_Sum) % 9)
          if result = 0, then Bhagyanka = 9
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Birth Date: August 27, 1984
- Day Sum: 2 + 7 = 9
- Month Sum: 0 + 8 = 8
- Year Sum: 1 + 9 + 8 + 4 = 22 → 2 + 2 = 4
- **Mulanka:** (9 + 8 + 4 - 1) % 9 + 1 = 20 % 9 + 1 = 3
- **Bhagyanka:** (9 + 8 + 4) % 9 = 21 % 9 = 3

**Result Range:** 1-9 (discrete, 9 possible values only)

### Number to Strength Mapping

```python
STRENGTH_MAP = {
    1: 90,  # SUN - Highly auspicious
    2: 75,  # MOON - Moderately beneficial
    3: 95,  # JUPITER - Highly beneficial
    4: 60,  # RAHU - Neutral to challenging
    5: 85,  # MERCURY - Beneficial
    6: 80,  # VENUS - Beneficial
    7: 65,  # KETU - Neutral to challenging
    8: 70,  # SATURN - Challenging but stabilizing
    9: 85   # MARS - Action-oriented, challenging
}
```

**Interpretation:**
- Numbers 3, 1, 5, 6, 9: Strong/favorable (75-95 strength)
- Numbers 2, 8: Moderate (70-75 strength)
- Numbers 4, 7: Weak/challenging (60-65 strength)

## 🔢 Data Distribution

### Vedic Astrology Strength Distribution (365-day period)

For each planet, the hourly strength values follow approximately normal distribution centered around 50 with standard deviation ~20:

```
Distribution Shape: Normal (Gaussian)
Mean Strength: 50.0
Standard Deviation: ~20.0
Min Value: 0 (occasional)
Max Value: 100 (occasional)
Q1 (25th percentile): ~35
Median (50th percentile): ~50
Q3 (75th percentile): ~65
```

### Vedic Numerology Strength Distribution (365-day period)

Numerology shows discrete distribution with 9 possible values:

```
Number 1: ~40 days of year (SUN strength = 90)
Number 2: ~41 days of year (MOON strength = 75)
Number 3: ~41 days of year (JUPITER strength = 95)
Number 4: ~41 days of year (RAHU strength = 60)
Number 5: ~40 days of year (MERCURY strength = 85)
Number 6: ~41 days of year (VENUS strength = 80)
Number 7: ~41 days of year (KETU strength = 65)
Number 8: ~40 days of year (SATURN strength = 70)
Number 9: ~41 days of year (MARS strength = 85)

Mean Strength: ~79.0 (weighted average)
Std Dev: ~10.0 (limited variation)
```

## 📐 Correlation Coefficient Interpretation

### Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r)

Measures linear relationship between two variables.

```
r = Σ[(x_i - mean_x)(y_i - mean_y)] / sqrt(Σ(x_i - mean_x)² × Σ(y_i - mean_y)²)
```

**Ranges:**

| Range | Interpretation | Expected Finding |
|-------|---|---|
| **0.90 to 1.00** | Very strong positive | Systems measure same thing |
| **0.70 to 0.89** | Strong positive | Systems closely related |
| **0.50 to 0.69** | Moderate positive | Systems somewhat related |
| **0.30 to 0.49** | Weak positive | Systems loosely related |
| **-0.30 to 0.29** | Negligible/None | Systems independent |
| **-0.49 to -0.30** | Weak negative | Inverse relationship |
| **-0.69 to -0.50** | Moderate negative | Inverse but related |
| **-0.89 to -0.70** | Strong negative | Closely inverse |
| **-1.00 to -0.90** | Very strong negative | Complete inverse |

### Research Expectation

Based on theoretical analysis, expect correlation values in **-0.29 to 0.29 range** indicating **negligible correlation** and system independence.

## 🎯 Key Data Differences

### Why Correlation Should Be Low

#### 1. Temporal Incompatibility
```
Astrology:    XXXXX    (continuous sampling 8,760 points)
Numerology:   X        (discrete sampling ~73 points)

Resolution mismatch = poor correlation potential
```

#### 2. Calculation Method Divergence
```
Astrology:     f(time, position, orbit) = continuous function
Numerology:    f(date, digits) = discrete lookup table

Different domains = independent results
```

#### 3. Frequency Mismatch
```
Astrology changes:     8,760 times per year
Numerology changes:    73 times per year
Ratio:                 120:1

High-frequency signal + low-frequency signal = poor correlation
```

#### 4. Value Range Differences
```
Astrology:     0-100 continuous (infinite possible values)
Numerology:    1-9 discrete (only 9 possible values)

Continuous variable × discrete variable = typically weak correlation
```

## 🔬 Assumptions and Limitations

### Assumptions Made
1. **Simulated Data:** Strength values generated mathematically, not from real astronomical calculations
2. **Sinusoidal Oscillations:** Planetary strengths follow sine wave patterns with added noise
3. **Fixed Numerology Mapping:** Each number 1-9 maps to fixed strength value
4. **Gaussian Noise:** Random variations added to astrology follow normal distribution

### Limitations
1. **Not Real Ephemeris Data:** Uses simulated values, not actual Swiss Ephemeris calculations
2. **Simplified Model:** Complex astrological rules reduced to mathematical functions
3. **No Real-World Events:** Can't validate against actual life outcomes
4. **Simulated Period:** Only 365 days - longer periods might show different patterns
5. **No Aspects/Transits:** Doesn't include planetary interactions/aspects

### Recommendations for Future Research
1. Use real ephemeris data (pyswisseph) instead of simulated values
2. Include planetary aspects and transits
3. Extend analysis to multiple years
4. Compare with empirical life events data
5. Validate with multiple birth charts
6. Include other numerology systems (Pythagorean, etc.)
