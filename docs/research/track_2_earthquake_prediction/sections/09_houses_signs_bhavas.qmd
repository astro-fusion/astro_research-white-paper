# Houses, Signs, and Bhava-Based Mundane Rules

Classical mundane astrology associates specific houses with land stability and catastrophe [@bphs]. We test **all planet-in-house** and **planet-in-sign** combinations, with emphasis on critical houses (4, 8, 12).

## House Occupancy

For each planet $p$:

$$
House(p) = \left\lfloor \frac{(\lambda_p - \lambda_{Asc}) \bmod 360}{30} \right\rfloor + 1
$$

## Sign Occupancy

Each planet’s zodiac sign is derived from its longitude and mapped to the sidereal sign index.

## Coverage

All planets × all houses and signs are enumerated in the master catalog.
