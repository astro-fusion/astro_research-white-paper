# Combustion, Retrograde, and Visibility

Combustion and retrograde status are classical modifiers of planetary efficacy [@bphs].

## Combustion

A planet is combust when within a defined orb of the Sun. We use **8°** as the standard orb:

$$
|\lambda_p - \lambda_{Sun}| < 8^\circ
$$

## Retrograde

A planet is retrograde when its longitudinal speed is negative:

$$
\dot{\lambda}_p(t) < 0
$$

All planets are evaluated daily for both conditions.
