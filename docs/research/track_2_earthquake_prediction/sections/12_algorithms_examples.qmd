# Algorithms and Worked Examples

This section formalizes each rule class into a concrete algorithmic procedure.

## Algorithm A: Daily Astro Feature Generation

1. Compute planetary longitudes at local noon for each day.
2. Derive retrograde and combustion status.
3. Compute Panchanga elements (tithi, karana, yoga).
4. Compute houses using ascendant at the same timestamp.
5. Store a daily feature table for downstream combination evaluation.

Implementation lives in `docs/research/track_2_earthquake_prediction/scripts/generate_daily_astro_features.py`.

## Algorithm B: Combination Evaluation

1. Load the daily feature table.
2. For each combination in the catalog, evaluate its rule across all days.
3. Compute activation frequency and overlap with earthquake event windows.
4. Store results for graphing and significance testing.

## Example: Aspect Rule (Mars–Saturn square)

Let $\Delta = |\lambda_{Mars} - \lambda_{Saturn}| \bmod 360$.

Rule triggers if:

$$
|\Delta - 90^\circ| \leq 5^\circ
$$

## Example: Graha Yuddha

For any planet pair $(i,j)$:

$$
|\lambda_i - \lambda_j| < 1^\circ
$$

## Example: Combustion

For planet $p$:

$$
|\lambda_p - \lambda_{Sun}| < 8^\circ
$$

## Example: Tithi

$$
Tithi = \left\lfloor \frac{(\lambda_{Moon}-\lambda_{Sun}) \bmod 360}{12} \\right\rfloor + 1
$$
