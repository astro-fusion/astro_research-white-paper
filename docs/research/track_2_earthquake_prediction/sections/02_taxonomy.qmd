# Mundane Jyotish Taxonomy (Exhaustive Scope)

This section defines the **complete combination space** used in the report. All combinations are derived from the canonical sources listed in Section 1 and formalized into a machine-readable taxonomy.

## Core Entities

- **Planets (Grahas)**: Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu, Ketu.
- **Lunar Elements**: Tithi, Nakshatra, Karana, Yoga.
- **Houses (Bhavas)**: 1–12 with emphasis on 4th (land), 8th (catastrophe), 12th (loss).
- **Signs (Rashi)**: 12 zodiac signs (sidereal).
- **Angular Relations**: Conjunction (0°), square (90°), opposition (180°), trine (120°), sextile (60°).
- **Temporal Windows**: {0, ±1, ±3, ±7, ±14, ±30} days.

## Combination Classes (All Included)

1. **Malefic Aspects**: Mars/Saturn/Rahu/Ketu hard aspects.
2. **Graha Yuddha**: Close conjunctions (<1°) between any pair.
3. **Shadbala Components**: Each component and total combined strength.
4. **Combustion & Retrograde**: Planet visibility and motion states.
5. **Eclipses & Syzygy**: Solar/lunar eclipses; new/full moon windows.
6. **Nakshatra Lords**: Lunar mansion rulerships and transitions.
7. **House/Sign Triggers**: Malefics in critical houses or signs.
8. **Panchanga**: Tithi/Karana/Yoga combinations.
9. **Compound Rules**: Multi-factor conjunctions (e.g., Mars+Saturn conjunction during eclipse window in 4th house).

## Ontology Fields (Catalog Columns)

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `combo_id` | Stable unique ID |
| `category` | Combination class |
| `rule` | Formal rule definition |
| `window_days` | Event window |
| `sources` | Classical references |
| `parameters` | Orbs, thresholds, rule-specific values |

## Formal Notation

- **Planetary longitude**: $\lambda_p(t)$
- **Aspect condition**: $|\lambda_i - \lambda_j| \in \{0°, 60°, 90°, 120°, 180°\} \pm \epsilon$
- **Conjunction (Graha Yuddha)**: $|\lambda_i - \lambda_j| < 1°$
- **Combustion**: $|\lambda_p - \lambda_{Sun}| < 8°$
- **Retrograde**: $\dot{\lambda}_p(t) < 0$

## Combination Explosion Control

To ensure “all combinations” is **computationally tractable**, we define a complete but finite rule system:

- All planet pairs/triples within the rule set.
- All major aspects with configurable orbs.
- All critical houses and signs with malefic occupancy.
- All Panchanga elements for daily classification.
- All defined time windows.

The master catalog is generated from these rules, guaranteeing exhaustive coverage without ambiguity.
