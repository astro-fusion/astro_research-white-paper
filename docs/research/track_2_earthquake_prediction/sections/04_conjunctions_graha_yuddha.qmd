# Conjunctions and Graha Yuddha

Classical texts describe **Graha Yuddha** (planetary war) as a critical indicator when two planets occupy nearly the same longitude [@bphs].

## Conjunction Rule

For any planet pair $(i,j)$:

$$
|\lambda_i - \lambda_j| \leq \epsilon
$$

We evaluate conjunctions at multiple orbs, and Graha Yuddha specifically at **1°**.

## Exhaustive Coverage

All planet pairs are tested. Malefic-only conjunctions are highlighted as a dedicated subset in the catalog.
