    "text": "2.1 Mythological & Archetypal Foundations\nTo understand why these systems are often conflated, one must examine their shared mythological roots. Each number in Vedic numerology is not merely a quantity but a symbol for a planetary deity’s energy pattern:\n\n1 - The Sun (Surya): The soul (\\(Atman\\)), the king, the ego. Just as the Sun is the center of the solar system, the number 1 represents unity, leadership, and the self. Mythologically, Surya rides a chariot of seven horses (colors of light), representing the source of all vitality.\n2 - The Moon (Chandra): The mind (\\(Manas\\)), emotions, and fluidity. Chandra is the queen, reflecting the light of the Sun. As the Moon waxes and wanes, so does the mind fluctuate.\n3 - Jupiter (Brihaspati): The Guru of the Devas. Represents wisdom, expansion, and ether (\\(Akasha\\)).\n4 - Rahu (North Node): The head of the demon, representing illusion (\\(Maya\\)), innovation, and unorthodoxy.\n5 - Mercury (Budha): The prince, representing intellect (\\(Buddhi\\)), communication, and trade.\n6 - Venus (Shukra): The Guru of the Asuras. Represents desire (\\(Kama\\)), beauty, and relationships.\n7 - Ketu (South Node): The headless body, representing spiritual liberation (\\(Moksha\\)), detachment, and mystery.\n8 - Saturn (Shani): The judge (\\(Karmakaraka\\)), representing discipline, delay, and truth (\\(Satya\\)).\n9 - Mars (Mangal): The commander, representing energy (\\(Shakti\\)), logic, and aggression."

    "text": "2.2 The Research Problem\nPractitioners often assume that if a person is in a “Sun period” in numerology (e.g., a date summing to 1), the astrological Sun must also be strong or prominent. This study challenges that assumption. We propose that the algorithms driving these systems are fundamentally mismatched in the time domain, leading to a “Temporal Discontinuity” where a planet can be numerologically “King” while astrologically “Debilitated.”"

    "section": "2.3 Literature Review",
    "text": "2.3 Literature Review\nHistorical and cultural discussions of numerology emphasize symbolic meaning and cross-cultural number mysticism, framing numbers as archetypal carriers of meaning rather than empirically testable signals (schimmel1975?). Sociological work has examined numerological associations in everyday life and how people integrate numeric symbolism into personal decision-making (benigeri1992?). Media and cultural studies have documented numerology and related occult practices as durable features of popular culture, reinforcing persistent narratives of meaningful numeric patterns (berger2006?; mcclelland2009?).\nFrom a psychological perspective, superstition and belief can measurably influence behavior and performance, suggesting that numeric belief systems can create real-world behavioral effects even when causal mechanisms are symbolic (damisch2010?). Statistical history and philosophy highlight the human tendency to impose structure on randomness, underscoring the importance of rigor when interpreting pattern-like signals (hacking1990?; stigler1986?).\nMethodologically, computational pattern analysis and signal comparison draw on modern statistical learning and data science foundations (bishop2006?). The analysis pipeline in this study leverages standard scientific computing tools for reproducibility and visualization (mckinney2010?; hunter2007?; pedregosa2011?), and follows a literate, transparent reporting approach for replicable research workflows (knuth84?).\nThis paper extends prior interpretive narratives by framing numerology and astrology as distinct time-domain signals, subject to the same alignment and frequency tests used in empirical time-series analysis."

We utilize the Swiss Ephemeris (DE431) for high-precision calculations.\nThe continuous position function \\(\\lambda_p(t)\\) for a planet \\(p\\) at time \\(t\\) involves: 1. Heliocentric Calculation: \\(r(t)\\) vector from Sun to Planet. 2. Geocentric Conversion: Adjusting for Earth’s position. 3. Sidereal Adjustment (Ayanamsa): Subtracting the precession of equinoxes using the Lahiri Ayanamsa (\\(\\alpha \\approx 24^\\circ\\)).\n\\[\n\\lambda_{sidereal}(t) = \\lambda_{tropical}(t) - \\alpha(t)\n\\]\n\n3.4.1 The Moon’s Vital Role: Nakshatras\nThe Moon is the fastest-moving body, traversing the zodiac in ~27.3 days. In Vedic Astrology, the zodiac is divided into 27 Nakshatras (Lunar Mansions) of \\(13^\\circ 20'\\) each.\nThe Nakshatra index \\(N\\) is calculated as:\n\\[\nN = \\lfloor \\frac{\\lambda_{Moon}}{13.333^\\circ} \\rfloor\n\\]\nEach Nakshatra is ruled by a planet (Lord) in a specific sequence (Ketu \\(\\to\\) Venus \\(\\to\\) Sun…).
