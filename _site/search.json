    "text": "2.1 The Source of the Formula\nThe Brihat Samhita dedicates multiple chapters (Adhyayas) to natural phenomena. Specifically, Chapter 32 (Bhukampa-lakshana-adhyaya) describes signs of impending earthquakes.\n\n2.1.1 Key Astrological Rules\n\nPlanetary Conjunctions (Yuti): The proximity of malefic planets in specific “sensitive” signs is a primary trigger.\n\nMars-Ketu Conjunction: Mars represents fire and raw energy; Ketu (South Node) represents sudden, explosive release. Their union is often cited as a precursor to violent volcanic or seismic activity.\nSaturn-Mars Aspects: The conflict between Shani (compression/pressure) and Mangal (expansive heat) creates tectonic tension.\n\nEclipses (Grahana): Solar and lunar eclipses within 15 days of each other create high gravitational tidal stress, which may act as a trigger for fault lines already under pressure.\nZodiacal Ingress (Sankranti): The entry of major planets (Saturn, Jupiter) into fixed signs (Sthira Rashis) or earth signs (Prithvi Rashis) is tested for correlation with increased seismic activity."

This allows for the personalization of seismic predictions to specific regions (e.g., Aries ruling certain mountainous terrains)."

In our dataset of top 20 earthquakes (Mag 8.0+) from 1950-2020: * 12 out of 20 events matched at least one major Medini rule. * 8 out of 20 events occurred during relatively “quiet” astrological periods.\nExample of a Miss: * 1964 Alaska Earthquake (Mag 9.2): While the second largest quake ever recorded, our standard “Mars-Ketu” or “Saturn-Mars” algorithms did not flag this date as critical.\n\n4.2.1 Investigating the Divergence\nThe existence of “Misses” suggests two possibilities: 1. Incomplete Rule Set: We may need to incorporate more subtle factors like Koorma Chakra (regional sensitivity) or Sanghatta Rashi (Vedha/Obstruction points). 2. Different Mechanisms: Some earthquakes may be purely tectonic “slips” with no cosmic trigger, whereas others are “cosmically induced.”"
