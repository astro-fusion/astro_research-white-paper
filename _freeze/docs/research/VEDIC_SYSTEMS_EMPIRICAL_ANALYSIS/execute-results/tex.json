Utilizing high-precision astronomical calculations from the Swiss Ephemeris (DE440), we conduct three parallel investigations: (1) the temporal correlation between discrete numerological cycles and continuous planetary dignities; (2) the potential of astrological configurations to predict seismic activity in the India-Nepal tectonic zone; and (3) the relationship between planetary positions and gold market (XAU/USD) price movements. Employing advanced econometric techniques including Granger causality tests, Lomb-Scargle spectral analysis, Monte Carlo permutation tests, and Negative Binomial regression, we subject each hypothesis to \"Severe Testing\" criteria. Our findings reveal that despite shared mythological foundations, these systems exhibit fundamental mathematical independence, with apparent correlations failing to exceed statistical significance thresholds when controlled for multiple hypothesis testing. This work provides a reproducible computational framework for the scientific evaluation of traditional knowledge systems.\nkeywords:\n  - Vedic Astrology\n  - Vedic Numerology\n  - Earthquake Prediction\n  - Financial Astrology\n  - Statistical Falsification\n  - Granger Causality\n  - Swiss Ephemeris\n  - Shadbala\nbibliography: references.bib\nformat:\n  pdf:\n    documentclass: article\n    papersize: a4\n    geometry:\n      - top=25mm\n      - left=25mm\n      - right=25mm\n      - bottom=25mm\n    fontsize: 11pt\n    number-sections: true\n    toc: true\n    toc-depth: 3\n    lof: true\n    lot: true\n    colorlinks: true\n    linkcolor: blue\n    citecolor: green\n    keep-tex: true\n  html:\n    toc: true\n    toc-depth: 3\n    number-sections: true\n    code-fold: true\nexecute:\n  echo: false\n  warning: false\n---\n\n# Introduction\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\nThe intersection of celestial observation and human affairs has been a cornerstone of civilizations across the globe. In the Indian subcontinent, this relationship crystallized into the sophisticated systems of **Vedic Astrology (Jyotish)**—literally \"the science of light\"—and **Vedic Numerology (Anka Jyotish)**—the science of numbers. Both systems claim to decode cosmic influences on terrestrial events, yet their mathematical foundations differ fundamentally.\n\nThis research initiative was born from a simple question: **Do these ancient systems possess empirical validity when subjected to modern statistical scrutiny?** Rather than approaching this question with either blind acceptance or dismissive skepticism, we apply the principles of \"Severe Testing\" [@mayo_severe_testing]—establishing clear null hypotheses and only rejecting them in the face of overwhelming statistical evidence.\n\n## Scope of Investigation\n\nThis report consolidates findings from three independent research tracks:\n\n1. **Track 1: Numerology-Astrology Temporal Discontinuity** — Investigating whether discrete numerological cycles correlate with continuous planetary strength scores.\n\n2. **Track 2: Earthquake Prediction Analysis** — Testing whether planetary configurations predict seismic activity in the India-Nepal tectonic zone.\n\n3. **Track 3: Gold Market Correlation** — Evaluating whether planetary positions influence XAU/USD spot prices, thus challenging the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH).\n\n## Research Philosophy\n\nWe adopt the stance of Karl Popper's falsificationism [@popper_falsification]: a hypothesis gains scientific credibility not through confirmation but through surviving rigorous attempts at falsification. Each research track is designed as an attempt to **disprove** rather than prove astrological claims.\n\n# Literature Review\n\n## Classical Vedic Sources\n\nThe foundational text of Vedic Astrology is the **Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra** (BPHS) [@bphs], attributed to Sage Parashara (c. 7th century CE). This text codifies:\n\n- **Rashi (Signs)**: 12 divisions of the ecliptic\n- **Nakshatras**: 27 lunar mansions\n- **Graha (Planets)**: 9 celestial bodies including lunar nodes\n- **Shadbala**: Six-fold planetary strength calculation\n\nThe astronomical calculations are grounded in the **Surya Siddhanta** [@surya_siddhanta], which provides remarkably accurate planetary ephemerides for its era. **Varahamihira's Brihat Samhita** [@varahamihira_brihat_samhita] extends these principles to mundane astrology, including predictions of earthquakes, weather, and political events.\n\nVedic Numerology draws from similar planetary associations, mapping integers 1-9 to the Navagraha (nine planets) through modulo-9 arithmetic on calendar dates.\n\n## Modern Statistical Framework\n\nOur methodology draws from established econometric and signal processing literature:\n\n- **Granger Causality** [@granger_causality]: Testing whether past values of one variable improve predictions of another\n- **Lomb-Scargle Spectral Analysis** [@lomb_scargle]: Detecting periodic signals in unevenly sampled data\n- **Unit Root Tests** [@dickey_fuller]: Ensuring stationarity for valid time-series inference\n- **Monte Carlo Methods** [@monte_carlo_methods]: Establishing empirical null distributions\n\n## Previous Studies\n\nPrior academic investigations of astrology have generally concluded null results. However, most studies suffer from:\n\n1. Imprecise astronomical calculations (using Western tropical zodiac instead of Vedic sidereal)\n2. Lack of Ayanamsa correction for precession\n3. Failure to test specific Vedic techniques (Shadbala, Dasha systems)\n\nThis study addresses these gaps by utilizing high-precision Swiss Ephemeris [@swiss_ephemeris] calculations with proper Lahiri Ayanamsa [@lahiri_ayanamsa] correction.\n\n# Methodology\n\n## Astronomical Calculations\n\n### Swiss Ephemeris Implementation\n\nAll planetary positions are calculated using the **Swiss Ephemeris (version 2.10)** with the DE440 JPL ephemeris, providing:\n\n- Positional accuracy: < 0.001 arcseconds (1 milliarcsecond)\n- Temporal range: 13201 BCE to 17191 CE\n- Proper sidereal conversion via Lahiri Ayanamsa\n\nThe sidereal longitude $\\lambda_{sid}$ is calculated as:\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{sid}(t) = \\lambda_{trop}(t) - \\alpha_{Lahiri}(t)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha_{Lahiri}(t)$ is the precession-corrected Ayanamsa value (approximately 24° in 2024).\n\n### Shadbala (Six-Fold Strength) Calculation\n\nFollowing BPHS specifications, planetary strength $\\sigma_p$ is computed as:\n\n$$\n\\sigma_p = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} w_i \\cdot B_i\n$$\n\nwhere the six Balas are:\n\n1. **Sthana Bala** (Positional): Sign placement (exaltation/debilitation)\n2. **Dig Bala** (Directional): House position from angles\n3. **Kala Bala** (Temporal): Day/night, hora, seasonal strength\n4. **Chesta Bala** (Motional): Speed and retrograde status\n5. **Naisargika Bala** (Natural): Intrinsic luminosity\n6. **Drik Bala** (Aspectual): Benefic/malefic aspects received\n\nEach component is normalized to a 0-100 scale for cross-planet comparison.\n\n## Numerological Calculations\n\nThe **Mulanka** (Root Number) for any date is calculated via digital root reduction:\n\n$$\nMulanka = ((Day - 1) \\bmod 9) + 1\n$$\n\nThe planetary mapping follows the standard Vedic schema:\n\n| Number | Planet | Sanskrit |\n|--------|--------|----------|\n| 1 | Sun | Surya |\n| 2 | Moon | Chandra |\n| 3 | Jupiter | Brihaspati |\n| 4 | Rahu | - |\n| 5 | Mercury | Budha |\n| 6 | Venus | Shukra |\n| 7 | Ketu | - |\n| 8 | Saturn | Shani |\n| 9 | Mars | Mangal |\n\n: Vedic Numerology Planetary Mapping {#tbl-numerology}\n\n## Statistical Framework\n\n### Stationarity Validation\n\nAll time series are tested for stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test [@dickey_fuller]:\n\n$$\nH_0: \\text{Series has a unit root (non-stationary)}\n$$\n\nNon-stationary series are differenced or log-transformed before analysis.\n\n### Granger Causality Testing\n\nFor each planetary variable $X$ and target variable $Y$, we test:\n\n$$\nH_0: X \\text{ does not Granger-cause } Y\n$$\n\nusing a Vector Autoregression (VAR) framework with optimal lag selection via AIC criterion.\n\n### Multiple Testing Correction\n\nTo control the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER) across multiple planet tests, we apply the Bonferroni correction:\n\n$$\n\\alpha_{adjusted} = \\frac{\\alpha}{n}\n$$\n\nwhere $n$ is the number of independent hypotheses tested.\n\n### Monte Carlo Permutation Testing\n\nTo establish empirical null distributions, we perform 1,000 Monte Carlo shuffles:\n\n1. Destroy temporal alignment between predictor and target\n2. Preserve internal autocorrelation structure\n3. Compute test statistic for each permutation\n4. Calculate p-value as proportion exceeding observed value\n\n# Track 1: Numerology-Astrology Temporal Discontinuity\n\n## Research Question\n\n**Do the discrete numerological cycles (changing daily) correlate with continuous planetary dignity scores (changing hourly)?**\n\n## Data Collection\n\n- **Period**: January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024\n- **Astrological Resolution**: 2-hour intervals (4,380 data points per planet)\n- **Numerological Resolution**: Daily values (365 data points)\n- **Location**: New Delhi, India (28.6°N, 77.1°E)\n\n### Visualizing Planetary Cycles\n\nThe following figure illustrates the normalized cyclic variations of key planets over the study period. Note the distinct frequencies of Mars vs. Saturn, highlighting the temporal complexity.\n\n![Planetary Cycles](../../reports/artifacts/fig_multi_planet_cycles.pdf){#fig-cycles width=100%}\n\n## Analysis: Temporal Mechanics Comparison\n\n### Frequency Mismatch\n\nThe fundamental observation is a **120:1 frequency mismatch**:\n\n- Astrology: 4,380 changes/year (sub-hourly variations)\n- Numerology: 73 changes/year (only when date digit changes)\n\nThis creates an inherent barrier to synchronization.\n\n### Cosine Similarity Analysis\n\nTo quantify independence, we computed the cosine similarity between normalized time series:\n\n$$\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{N}}{\\|\\vec{A}\\| \\|\\vec{N}\\|}\n$$\n\n**Result**: $\\cos(\\theta) = 0.0052$, indicating **99.48% mathematical orthogonality**.\n\n### Nakshatra-Day Mapping\n\nWe tested whether the \"Mulanka Planet\" of the day matches the \"Nakshatra Lord\" (ruler of the Moon's constellation):\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Total Days Tested | 365 |\n| Exact Matches | 41 |\n| Match Rate | 11.23% |\n| Expected by Chance | 11.11% (1/9) |\n\n: Nakshatra-Day Synchronization Test {#tbl-nakshatra}\n\n**Conclusion**: The match rate is statistically indistinguishable from random chance.\n\n## Track 1 Findings\n\n1. **Temporal Mismatch**: The systems operate on fundamentally different temporal grids\n2. **Mathematical Orthogonality**: 99.48% independence between signals\n3. **No Synchronization**: Nakshatra-Day matching equals random chance\n\n# Track 2: Earthquake Prediction Analysis\n\n## Research Question\n\n**Do planetary configurations (Shadbala, aspects, yogas) predict seismic activity in the India-Nepal tectonic zone?**\n\n## Data Collection\n\n- **Source**: USGS Earthquake Hazards Program API [@usgs_earthquake]\n- **Region**: India-Nepal Border (Lat 20°N-35°N, Lon 75°E-90°E)\n- **Period**: January 1, 2015 to January 1, 2024\n- **Threshold**: Magnitude ≥ 4.5\n- **Total Events**: 370 earthquakes\n\n## Methodology\n\n### Planetary Stress Index\n\nWe defined an \"Astro-Fusion Stress Index\" based on:\n\n1. **Low Aggregate Shadbala**: Planetary instability\n2. **Graha Yuddha**: Planetary wars (conjunctions within 1°)\n3. **Malefic Aspects**: Saturn-Mars squares and oppositions\n\n![Mars Retrograde Cycles and Daily Motion](../../reports/artifacts/fig_mars_variation.pdf){#fig-mars width=100%}\n\n### Statistical Framework\n\nUsing Negative Binomial regression [@molchan_diagram] to account for overdispersion:\n\n$$\n\\ln(\\mu_t) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_{trend}t + \\beta_{season}\\sin(\\frac{2\\pi t}{365}) + \\beta_{astro}X_{astro}\n$$\n\n## Results\n\n### Regression Coefficients\n\n| Variable | Coefficient | Std.

They appear to measure different conceptual dimensions:\n\n- **Numerology**: Symbolic/archetypal rhythm tied to human calendar constructs\n- **Astrology**: Physical/astronomical rhythm tied to observable celestial mechanics\n\n### The Role of Pattern Recognition\n\nHuman cognition is predisposed to pattern recognition, often perceiving meaningful signals in random noise—a phenomenon known as **apophenia**. Our Monte Carlo analyses consistently demonstrate that apparent astrological \"signals\" fall within the distribution expected from random chance.\n\n## Limitations\n\n1. **Geographic Specificity**: Earthquake analysis limited to India-Nepal region\n2. **Temporal Scope**: 25 years for gold, 10 years for earthquakes\n3. **Linear Methods**: Non-linear relationships not fully explored\n4. **Technique Coverage**: Many advanced Jyotish techniques (e.g., Ashtakavarga, Koorma Chakra) not tested\n\n## Future Research Directions\n\n1. **Extended Datasets**: Analysis with >100,000 earthquake events globally\n2. **Non-Linear Models**: Machine learning approaches (Random Forests, Neural Networks)\n3. **Regional Hypotheses**: Testing Koorma Chakra (regional zodiac mapping) for earthquakes\n4. **Alternative Ayanamsas**: Comparison of Lahiri, Raman, and Krishnamurti systems\n\n# Conclusions\n\nThis consolidated research report represents the most comprehensive computational investigation of Vedic predictive systems to date. Our findings support the following conclusions:\n\n1. **Temporal Discontinuity Confirmed**: Vedic Astrology and Numerology operate on fundamentally incompatible temporal grids, rendering assumptions of synchronization unfounded.\n\n2. **Earthquake Prediction Null**: Planetary configurations, as operationalized through Shadbala and aspects, do not provide statistically significant predictive power for seismic events in the tested region.\n\n3. **Financial Astrology Falsified**: The Efficient Market Hypothesis is supported; planetary positions contain no unique information for gold price prediction.\n\n4. **Methodological Contribution**: We provide a reproducible, open-source framework for testing similar claims, embodying the principles of Literate Programming [@knuth_literate].\n\n5. **Cultural Value Preserved**: The failure to demonstrate predictive validity does not diminish the cultural, philosophical, and historical significance of these systems. They remain valuable frameworks for symbolic interpretation and personal meaning-making.\n\n## Final Statement\n\nScience advances through the courageous application of skepticism to cherished beliefs. This study demonstrates that Vedic predictive systems, while rich in cultural meaning, do not withstand empirical scrutiny when tested against observable phenomena. We publish these findings not to denigrate tradition, but to contribute to the honest evaluation of knowledge claims—a principle that the ancient Vedic sages themselves would likely endorse.\n\n---\n\n*This research was conducted using open-source tools and reproducible methods.
