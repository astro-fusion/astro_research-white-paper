Despite sharing a common mythological lineage where numbers are mapped to planetary deities, our computational analysis reveals a fundamental temporal discontinuity. Using the Swiss Ephemeris (DE440) for sub-arcsecond precision astronomical calculations, we demonstrate that Numerology operates on a discrete, low-frequency temporal grid (changing ~73 times annually), while Astrology functions as a high-frequency continuous system (Moon changes Nakshatra ~27 times monthly). Mathematical analysis reveals 99.48% orthogonality between the normalized time series, and Nakshatra-Day mapping shows synchronization rates (11.23%) statistically indistinguishable from random chance (11.11%). These findings establish that despite mythological connections, Vedic Numerology and Vedic Astrology should be treated as distinct, non-interchangeable predictive frameworks providing independent information dimensions.\nkeywords:\n  - Vedic Numerology\n  - Vedic Astrology\n  - Temporal Discontinuity\n  - Shadbala\n  - Nakshatra\n  - Cosine Similarity\n  - Swiss Ephemeris\nbibliography: ../references.bib\nformat:\n  pdf:\n    documentclass: article\n    papersize: a4\n    geometry:\n      - top=25mm\n      - left=25mm\n      - right=25mm\n      - bottom=25mm\n    fontsize: 11pt\n    number-sections: true\n    toc: true\n    lof: true\n    lot: true\n    colorlinks: true\n  html:\n    toc: true\n    number-sections: true\nexecute:\n  echo: false\n  warning: false\n---\n\n# Master Structure\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThis report is assembled from modular sections to provide detailed analysis and interactive visualizations.\n:::\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe intersection of mathematics and mythology forms the backbone of ancient predictive sciences. In the Vedic tradition, the cosmos is viewed not as a random assembly of matter but as a conscious, interconnected system governed by **Grahas** (planets) which act as agents of karma. Two primary systems evolved to interpret these influences: **Vedic Astrology (Jyotish)**, which relies on the continuous astronomical position of celestial bodies, and **Numerology (Anka Jyotish)**, which abstracts these movements into discrete integer values based on calendar dates.\n\n## Mythological & Archetypal Foundations\n\nTo understand why these systems are often conflated, one must examine their shared mythological roots. Each number in Vedic numerology is not merely a quantity but a symbol for a planetary deity's energy pattern:\n\n*   **1 - The Sun (Surya)**: The soul ($Atman$), the king, the ego. Just as the Sun is the center of the solar system, the number 1 represents unity, leadership, and the self. Mythologically, Surya rides a chariot of seven horses (colors of light), representing the source of all vitality.\n*   **2 - The Moon (Chandra)**: The mind ($Manas$), emotions, and fluidity. Chandra is the queen, reflecting the light of the Sun. As the Moon waxes and wanes, so does the mind fluctuate.\n*   **3 - Jupiter (Brihaspati)**: The Guru of the Devas. Represents wisdom, expansion, and ether ($Akasha$).\n*   **4 - Rahu (North Node)**: The head of the demon, representing illusion ($Maya$), innovation, and unorthodoxy.\n*   **5 - Mercury (Budha)**: The prince, representing intellect ($Buddhi$), communication, and trade.\n*   **6 - Venus (Shukra)**: The Guru of the Asuras. Represents desire ($Kama$), beauty, and relationships.\n*   **7 - Ketu (South Node)**: The headless body, representing spiritual liberation ($Moksha$), detachment, and mystery.\n*   **8 - Saturn (Shani)**: The judge ($Karmakaraka$), representing discipline, delay, and truth ($Satya$).\n*   **9 - Mars (Mangal)**: The commander, representing energy ($Shakti$), logic, and aggression.\n\n## The Research Problem\n\nPractitioners often assume that if a person is in a \"Sun period\" in numerology (e.g., a date summing to 1), the astrological Sun must also be strong or prominent. **This study challenges that assumption.** We propose that the *algorithms* driving these systems are fundamentally mismatched in the time domain, leading to a \"Temporal Discontinuity\" where a planet can be numerologically \"King\" while astrologically \"Debilitated.\"\n\n## Literature Review\n\nHistorical and cultural discussions of numerology emphasize symbolic meaning and cross-cultural number mysticism, framing numbers as archetypal carriers of meaning rather than empirically testable signals [@schimmel1975]. Sociological work has examined numerological associations in everyday life and how people integrate numeric symbolism into personal decision-making [@benigeri1992]. Media and cultural studies have documented numerology and related occult practices as durable features of popular culture, reinforcing persistent narratives of meaningful numeric patterns [@berger2006; @mcclelland2009].\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, superstition and belief can measurably influence behavior and performance, suggesting that numeric belief systems can create real-world behavioral effects even when causal mechanisms are symbolic [@damisch2010]. Statistical history and philosophy highlight the human tendency to impose structure on randomness, underscoring the importance of rigor when interpreting pattern-like signals [@hacking1990; @stigler1986].\n\nMethodologically, computational pattern analysis and signal comparison draw on modern statistical learning and data science foundations [@bishop2006]. The analysis pipeline in this study leverages standard scientific computing tools for reproducibility and visualization [@mckinney2010; @hunter2007; @pedregosa2011], and follows a literate, transparent reporting approach for replicable research workflows [@knuth84].\n\nThis paper extends prior interpretive narratives by framing numerology and astrology as **distinct time-domain signals**, subject to the same alignment and frequency tests used in empirical time-series analysis.\n\n## Research Questions & Hypotheses\n\nWe formalize the investigation into testable hypotheses:\n\n*   **RQ1**: How often does the numerological ruling planet match the Moon's Nakshatra lord on the same day?\n*   **RQ2**: Are any months or seasons more aligned than others?\n*   **RQ3**: Do numerology and astrology exhibit similar frequency signatures in the time domain?\n\n**H1 (Null)**: Numerology-astrology alignment occurs at random chance (~11.1%).\n**H2 (Alternative)**: Alignment is significantly higher than chance, indicating synchronous operation.\n\n# Mathematical & Computational Methodology\n\nOur research employs a rigorous computational pipeline to model both systems simultaneously.\n\n## Data Sources & Experimental Design\n\n*   **Timeframe**: January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 (365 days).\n*   **Location**: New Delhi, India (28.6°N, 77.1°E).\n*   **Astrology Engine**: Swiss Ephemeris (DE431) with Lahiri Ayanamsa.\n*   **Sampling Resolution**: Daily (numerology) and noon-time lunar position (astrology).\n\nWe intentionally use **daily sampling** to respect numerology's discrete granularity and compare it directly to the Moon's ruling Nakshatra lord.\n\n## Athlete Name + Birthdate Dataset\n\nTo test **name-based numerology** against **birth-based numerology**, we use a sampled athlete dataset with name and birth date fields (N=500). This enables correlation analysis between expression numbers and life-path numbers.\n\nDataset: `use_cases/numerology/research_paper/data/athletes_sample.csv` (source: @athletes_dataset_stat408)\n\n## Numerology Algorithm: Modulo-9 Arithmetic\n\nVedic numerology uses a base-9 system. The \"Mulanka\" (Root Number) is the most rapidly changing daily indicator. It is derived from the day of the month ($D$) using digital root summation, which is mathematically equivalent to modulo-9 arithmetic (with 9 replacing 0).\n\nThe algorithm for the Ruling Planet $P_{num}$ on day $D$ is:\n\n$$\nV = (D - 1) \\bmod 9 + 1\n$$\n\nWhere $V$ maps to the planet list: $\\{1 \\to Sun, 2 \\to Moon, \\dots, 9 \\to Mars\\}$.\nThis function is a **discrete step function** $f(t)$ that holds a constant integer value for 24 hours (or until the next calendar sunrise).\n\n## Astrology Algorithm: Continuous Celestial Mechanics\n\nVedic Astrology requires determining the precise position of planets on the Ecliptic. We utilize the **Swiss Ephemeris (DE431)** for high-precision calculations.\n\nThe continuous position function $\\lambda_p(t)$ for a planet $p$ at time $t$ involves:\n1.  **Heliocentric Calculation**: $r(t)$ vector from Sun to Planet.\n2.  **Geocentric Conversion**: Adjusting for Earth's position.\n3.  **Sidereal Adjustment (Ayanamsa)**: Subtracting the precession of equinoxes using the Lahiri Ayanamsa ($\\alpha \\approx 24^\\circ$).\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{sidereal}(t) = \\lambda_{tropical}(t) - \\alpha(t)\n$$\n\n### The Moon's Vital Role: Nakshatras\n\nThe Moon is the fastest-moving body, traversing the zodiac in ~27.3 days. In Vedic Astrology, the zodiac is divided into 27 **Nakshatras** (Lunar Mansions) of $13^\\circ 20'$ each.\n\nThe Nakshatra index $N$ is calculated as:\n\n$$\nN = \\lfloor \\frac{\\lambda_{Moon}}{13.333^\\circ} \\rfloor\n$$\n\nEach Nakshatra is ruled by a planet (Lord) in a specific sequence (Ketu $\\to$ Venus $\\to$ Sun...). This creates a **Nakshatra-based planetary cycle** that generates the astrological \"mood\" of the day, which can be directly compared to the Numerological ruling planet.\n\n## Derived Variables\n\nThe computational pipeline produces the following core variables per day:\n\n| Variable | Definition | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `mulanka` | Digital root of day (1-9) | Discrete |\n| `numerology_lord` | Planet mapped from `mulanka` | Categorical |\n| `nakshatra_lord` | Planet ruling the Moon's Nakshatra | Categorical |\n| `match` | 1 if lords align, else 0 | Binary |\n\n## Methodology Pipeline & Algorithm\n\nThe full pipeline is designed to be deterministic and reproducible from raw dates and location.\n\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart TD\n  A[\"Date (YYYY-MM-DD)\"] --> B[\"Mulanka via digital root\"]\n  A --> C[\"Moon longitude (Swiss Ephemeris)\"]\n  C --> D[\"Nakshatra index\"]\n  D --> E[\"Nakshatra lord\"]\n  B --> F[\"Numerology lord\"]\n  F --> G[\"Match?\"]\n  E --> G\n  G --> H[\"Metrics + Figures\"]\n```\n\n\n**Algorithm 1: Daily Alignment Pipeline**\n\n1. **Input**: Date range, latitude, longitude, and ayanamsa system.\n2. **Compute Numerology**: For each date, compute Mulanka $V = (D-1) \\bmod 9 + 1$ and map to a numerology lord.\n3. **Compute Astrology**: For each date, compute Moon longitude at local noon and map to Nakshatra lord.\n4. **Align**: Record whether numerology lord equals Nakshatra lord.\n5. **Analyze**: Compute alignment rate, confusion matrix, monthly trends, and spectral signatures.\n\n# Data Analysis & Results\n\nWe analyzed the daily planetary status for the full year of 2024.\n\n\n\n## 1. The Temporal Mismatch\n\nThe graph below visualizes the fundamental disconnect. The **Blue Line** represents the Numerology Number (1-9) changing strictly with the calendar. The **Red Dots** represent the Nakshatra Lord (mapped to 1-9 scale) as determined by the Moon's actual position.\n\nNote the **irregularity** of the Red Dots compared to the **step-wise** Blue Line. The Moon does not follow the Gregorian calendar; it follows celestial time.\n\n::: {.cell fig-height='5' fig-width='10' execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Temporal Discontinuity: Numerology (Blue) vs Astrology (Red) over 2 months](NUMEROLOGY_ASTROLOGY_TEMPORAL_DISCONTINUITY_files/figure-pdf/fig-mismatch-output-1.png){#fig-mismatch fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 2.

Detailed Moon Phase Variation\n\nBeyond just the Nakshatra, the Moon's \"mood\" is heavily influenced by its phase (Paksha). Numerology treats every \"2\" (Moon number) day as identical. However, Astrology distinguishes between:\n*   **Shukla Paksha (Waxing)**: Growth, accumulation (Positive Moon).\n*   **Krishna Paksha (Waning)**: Decay, release (Negative/Weak Moon).\n\nThe following chart tracks the Moon's longitude over the year, showing the rapid, continuous cycle that numerology flattens into a single digit.\n\n::: {.cell fig-height='4' fig-width='10' execution_count=8}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![The Continuous Wave: Moon's Journey through the Zodiac](NUMEROLOGY_ASTROLOGY_TEMPORAL_DISCONTINUITY_files/figure-pdf/fig-moon-cycle-output-1.png){#fig-moon-cycle fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 8.

It is assumed that dates with repeating numbers (e.g., 22-02-2022) act as massive amplifiers for the corresponding planetary energy (Moon = 2).\n\nWe tested this hypothesis by searching for **\"Divergence Dates\"**: days where a number appears frequently (High Numerological \"Strength\") but the actual planet is weak or debilitated in the sky.\n\n## Methodology\n\n1.  **Digit Frequency ($F_d$)**: We count the occurrences of digits 1-9 in the date string (YYYY-MM-DD). If $F_d \\ge 3$, we consider it a \"Numerologically Strong\" day for that number.\n2.  **Astrological Dignity ($D_p$)**: We calculate the dignity score (0-100) for the corresponding planet. If $D_p \\le 30$, we consider it \"Astrologically Weak\".\n3.  **Divergence**: A match occurs when $F_d \\ge 3$ AND $D_p \\le 30$.\n\n## Case Studies of Divergence\n\nThe following analysis scans our 5-year dataset to expose these illusions.\n\n::: {.cell tbl-cap='Critical Divergence Dates: High Repetition vs Low Strength' execution_count=10}\n\n::: {#divergence-analysis .cell-output .cell-output-display .cell-output-markdown}\n| Date       |   Number | Planet   | Repetition   | Astro State            |\n|:-----------|---------:|:---------|:-------------|:-----------------------|\n| 2024-02-02 |        2 | Moon     | 4 times      | Debilitated in Scorpio |\n| 2024-02-03 |        2 | Moon     | 3 times      | Debilitated in Scorpio |\n| 2024-02-29 |        2 | Moon     | 4 times      | Debilitated in Scorpio |\n| 2024-03-02 |        2 | Moon     | 3 times      | Debilitated in Scorpio |\n| 2024-03-27 |        2 | Moon     | 3 times      | Debilitated in Scorpio |\n| 2024-03-28 |        2 | Moon     | 3 times      | Debilitated in Scorpio |\n| 2024-03-29 |        2 | Moon     | 3 times      | Debilitated in Scorpio |\n| 2024-04-24 |        2 | Moon     | 3 times      | Debilitated in Scorpio |\n| 2024-04-25 |        2 | Moon     | 3 times      | Debilitated in Scorpio |\n| 2024-05-21 |        2 | Moon     | 3 times      | Debilitated in Scorpio |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Analysis of Findings\n\nThe table above (if populated) highlights dates where users might be misled by the calendar. \n\n**Hypothetical Example: The Moon in Scorpio Trap**\nIf the date `2022-02-22` (or similar) occurred while the Moon was in Scorpio (its sign of debilitation), numerology would predict a \"Dual Master Number\" day of immense intuition and connection (2). However, Astrologically, a debilitated Moon creates emotional volatility, jealousy, and fear. \n\n*   **Numerology says**: \"Connect, feel, unite.\"\n*   **Astrology says**: \"Protect your energy, avoid paranoia.\"\n\nThis **negative correlation** is dangerous. Following numerological advice to \"open up\" during a debilitated Moon transit could lead to psychological distress.\n\n# Robustness Checks\n\nWe test sensitivity to time-of-day and location. If numerology were genuinely synchronized with astrology, match rates should remain stable across observation conditions.\n\n::: {.cell tbl-cap='Robustness Checks: Match Rates Across Locations & Times' execution_count=11}\n\n::: {#robustness .cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=38}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Location</th>\n      <th>Noon Match %</th>\n      <th>Midnight Match %</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>New Delhi</td>\n      <td>10.38</td>\n      <td>15.03</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>Kathmandu</td>\n      <td>10.38</td>\n      <td>15.03</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>New York</td>\n      <td>10.38</td>\n      <td>15.03</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Ethical & Practical Considerations\n\nThis study evaluates symbolic systems using quantitative methods.

By upgrading our analysis to include **Nakshatra algorithms** and **Lunar dynamics**, we have established:\n\n1.  **Mythological Consistency, Mathematical Divergence**: While both systems invoke the same deities (Surya, Chandra, etc.), their mathematical invocation of these deities occurs on disjoint timelines.\n2.  **The Illusion of Sync**: The perceived correlation between a \"Number 1 Day\" and \"Sun Energy\" is purely psychological, as the astrological Sun may be in a position of weakness (e.g., Libra) or darkness (Night) on that very day.\n3.  **Scientific Domain Separation**: Numerology should be viewed as a **symbolic/archetypal** rhythm tied to the human construct of calendars, while Vedic Astrology is a **physical/astronomical** rhythm tied to observable celestial mechanics.\n\nResearchers and practitioners must therefore treat these as independent variables in any predictive model, rather than assuming they reinforce each other.\n\n# References\n1. *BPHS (Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra)*.

Catalog)\n\nThe project maintains a shared **Vedic Principles Catalog** that enumerates the core and extended Jyotish concepts described in classical texts such as **BPHS**, **Brihat Samhita**, **Saravali**, **Jataka Parijata**, and **Surya Siddhanta**. This numerology report uses a focused subset (planetary lords, dignity, and nakshatra mapping) and documents the rest for completeness. This guarantees future expansion without altering the report structure.

Reduction)\n\n$$\nDR(n) = (n - 1) \\bmod 9 + 1\n$$\n\n## Universal Day Number (UDN)\n\n$$\nUDN = DR(day + month + sum(year\\_digits))\n$$\n\n## Universal Month Number (UMN)\n\n$$\nUMN = DR(month + sum(year\\_digits))\n$$\n\n## Universal Year Number (UYN)\n\n$$\nUYN = DR(sum(year\\_digits))\n$$\n\n## Missing Number Analysis (Lo Shu)\n\nCount digits 1–9 in the date string (YYYYMMDD). A number is **missing** if count = 0.\n\n## Pythagorean Name Numerology (Expression, Soul Urge, Personality)\n\nMap letters to 1–9 using the Pythagorean table and reduce:\n\n```\n1: A J S\n2: B K T\n3: C L U\n4: D M V\n5: E N W\n6: F O X\n7: G P Y\n8: H Q Z\n9: I R\n```\n\n- **Expression**: sum of all letter values\n- **Soul Urge**: sum of vowels only\n- **Personality**: sum of consonants only\n\n## Chaldean Name Numerology\n\nMap letters to 1–8 using the Chaldean table and reduce:\n\n```\n1: A I J Q Y\n2: B K R\n3: C G L S\n4: D M T\n5: E H N X\n6: U V W\n7: O Z\n8: F P\n```\n\n## Master Numbers\n\nMaster numbers (11, 22, 33) are optionally preserved instead of reduction.\n\n## Karmic Debt Numbers\n\nIf compound numbers 13, 14, 16, 19 appear, they are flagged as special karmic patterns.\n\n## Life Path Number (Birth Date)\n\nSum all digits of the birth date (YYYYMMDD) and reduce.\n\n## Pinnacles & Challenges\n\nLet:\n- $M = DR(month)$, $D = DR(day)$, $Y = DR(year)$\n\nPinnacles:\n- $P1 = DR(M + D)$\n- $P2 = DR(D + Y)$\n- $P3 = DR(P1 + P2)$\n- $P4 = DR(M + Y)$\n\nChallenges:\n- $C1 = |M - D|$\n- $C2 = |D - Y|$\n- $C3 = |C1 - C2|$\n- $C4 = |M - Y|$\n\n# Frequency & Distribution Graphs\n\nThis section plots **frequency and distribution** of numerological patterns (UDN/UMN/UYN, missing numbers).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell fig-height='4' fig-width='7.5' execution_count=18}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Universal Day Number (UDN) Frequency](NUMEROLOGY_ASTROLOGY_TEMPORAL_DISCONTINUITY_files/figure-pdf/fig-udn-output-1.png){#fig-udn fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell fig-height='4' fig-width='7.5' execution_count=19}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Life Path Distribution (Birth Dataset)](NUMEROLOGY_ASTROLOGY_TEMPORAL_DISCONTINUITY_files/figure-pdf/fig-life-path-output-1.png){#fig-life-path fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell fig-height='4' fig-width='7.5' execution_count=20}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Name-Based Expression Number Distribution (Pythagorean)](NUMEROLOGY_ASTROLOGY_TEMPORAL_DISCONTINUITY_files/figure-pdf/fig-name-expression-output-1.png){#fig-name-expression fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell fig-height='4' fig-width='8' execution_count=21}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Missing Number Frequency (Lo Shu)](NUMEROLOGY_ASTROLOGY_TEMPORAL_DISCONTINUITY_files/figure-pdf/fig-missing-output-1.png){#fig-missing fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Alignment & Window Graphs\n\nThis section compares **numerology transits** to astrological alignment windows and provides windowed overlap charts.\n\n::: {#fig-udn-monthly .cell fig-height='4' fig-width='8' execution_count=22}\n\n::: {#fig-udn-monthly-1 .cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\n<Figure size 2700x1200 with 0 Axes>\n```\n\nMonthly UDN Distribution\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](NUMEROLOGY_ASTROLOGY_TEMPORAL_DISCONTINUITY_files/figure-pdf/fig-udn-monthly-output-2.png){#fig-udn-monthly-2 fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell fig-height='4' fig-width='8' execution_count=23}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Name-Based Soul Urge Distribution (Pythagorean vs Chaldean)](NUMEROLOGY_ASTROLOGY_TEMPORAL_DISCONTINUITY_files/figure-pdf/fig-name-soul-urge-output-1.png){#fig-name-soul-urge fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell fig-height='4' fig-width='8' execution_count=24}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Pinnacle Distributions (Birth Dataset)](NUMEROLOGY_ASTROLOGY_TEMPORAL_DISCONTINUITY_files/figure-pdf/fig-pinnacle-output-1.png){#fig-pinnacle fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell fig-height='4' fig-width='7.5' execution_count=25}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Name vs Birth Numerology Correlation (Athletes Sample)](NUMEROLOGY_ASTROLOGY_TEMPORAL_DISCONTINUITY_files/figure-pdf/fig-athlete-correlation-output-1.png){#fig-athlete-correlation fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell fig-height='4' fig-width='8' execution_count=27}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Missing Number Heatmap by Month](NUMEROLOGY_ASTROLOGY_TEMPORAL_DISCONTINUITY_files/figure-pdf/fig-missing-heatmap-output-1.png){#fig-missing-heatmap fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Legacy Content (Migrated)\n\nAll content has been migrated into the modular section files.\n\n",
