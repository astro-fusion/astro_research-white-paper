Despite sharing a common mythological lineage where numbers are mapped to planetary deities (e.g., 1 = Sun/Surya), our computational analysis of five years of high-precision astronomical data reveals a fundamental temporal discontinuity. using the Swiss Ephemeris for 0.001-arcsecond precision, we demonstrate that while Numerology operates on a discrete, low-frequency temporal grid (changing ~73 times/year), Astrology functions as a high-frequency continuous system (Moon changes Nakshatra ~27 times/month). We introduce a novel \"Nakshatra-Day Mapping\" analysis, showing that the ruling planet of the day (Numerology) matches the ruling planet of the Moon's constellation (Astrology) less than 15% of the time, effectively debunking the assumption of synchronous operation. This paper provides the mathematical algorithms, mythological context, and statistical evidence necessary to treat these systems as distinct, non-interchangeable predictive frameworks.\nkeywords:\n  - Numerology\n  - Vedic Astrology\n  - Planetary Strength\n  - Nakshatra Dynamics\n  - Computational Astrology\nbibliography: ../references.bib\nformat:\n  html: {}\n  pdf:\n    documentclass: article\n    geometry:\n      - top=25mm\n      - left=20mm\n      - right=20mm\n      - bottom=25mm\n    fontsize: 11pt\n    linestretch: 1.2\n    number-sections: true\n    toc: true\n    lof: true\n    lot: true\n    fig-pos: 'H'\n    keep-tex: true\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\usepackage{float}\n        \\usepackage{placeins}\njupyter: astro-research-venv\n---\n\n# Master Structure\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nThis report is assembled from modular sections for maintainability.\n:::\n\n:::{include=\"sections/00_overview.qmd\"}\n:::\n\n:::{include=\"sections/01_literature_review.qmd\"}\n:::\n\n:::{include=\"sections/02_questions_hypotheses.qmd\"}\n:::\n\n:::{include=\"sections/03_methods_data.qmd\"}\n:::\n\n:::{include=\"sections/04_algorithms_pipeline.qmd\"}\n:::\n\n:::{include=\"sections/05_results_graphs.qmd\"}\n:::\n\n:::{include=\"sections/06_robustness_limits_ethics.qmd\"}\n:::\n\n:::{include=\"sections/07_reproducibility.qmd\"}\n:::\n\n:::{include=\"sections/08_conclusion.qmd\"}\n:::\n\n:::{include=\"sections/09_principles_catalog.qmd\"}\n:::\n\n:::{include=\"sections/10_algorithms_examples.qmd\"}\n:::\n\n:::{include=\"sections/11_graphs_frequency.qmd\"}\n:::\n\n:::{include=\"sections/12_graphs_alignment_windows.qmd\"}\n:::\n\n:::{include=\"sections/90_legacy_content.qmd\"}\n:::\n\n",
