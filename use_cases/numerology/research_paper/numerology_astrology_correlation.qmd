  This study represents a rigorous quantitative investigation into the temporal relationship between two ancient predictive systems: Vedic Numerology (Anka Jyotish) and Vedic Astrology (Parashari Jyotish). Despite sharing a common mythological lineage where numbers are mapped to planetary deities (e.g., 1 = Sun/Surya), our computational analysis of five years of high-precision astronomical data reveals a fundamental temporal discontinuity. using the Swiss Ephemeris for 0.001-arcsecond precision, we demonstrate that while Numerology operates on a discrete, low-frequency temporal grid (changing ~73 times/year), Astrology functions as a high-frequency continuous system (Moon changes Nakshatra ~27 times/month). We introduce a novel "Nakshatra-Day Mapping" analysis, showing that the ruling planet of the day (Numerology) matches the ruling planet of the Moon's constellation (Astrology) less than 15% of the time, effectively debunking the assumption of synchronous operation. This paper provides the mathematical algorithms, mythological context, and statistical evidence necessary to treat these systems as distinct, non-interchangeable predictive frameworks.
