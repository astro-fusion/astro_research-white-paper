  This study conducts a rigorous statistical audit of the "Astro-Fusion" hypothesis, which posits that discrete numerological time cycles and planetary configurations (specifically Vedic *Shadbala*) act as exogenous triggers for global seismicity. Using a Negative Binomial Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to account for overdispersion in the USGS earthquake catalog, we test whether these variables provide information gain over a standard Poisson baseline of seismicity (Trend + Seasonality). Our analysis focuses on the prediction of daily earthquake counts (M5.0+) and employs a "Look-Elsewhere" effect methodology (Monte Carlo randomization) to control for false discoveries. The results indicate that while certain high-magnitude events align with classical astrological "Yogas," the global statistical signal for numerological precursors remains weak when controlled for multiple hypothesis testing.

# Introduction

The prediction of earthquakes remains one of the most persistent challenges in geophysical science. The "Prediction Gap"—the inability to deterministically forecast the time, location, and magnitude of rupture—stems from the non-linear, chaotic nature of crustal stress accumulation.

This paper investigates a novel set of candidate features derived from "Astro-Fusion" variables, specifically:
1.  **Universal Day Numbers (UDN):** A cyclic base-9 numerological time series.
2.  **Planetary Force Vectors:** Quantified "Shadbala" strength scores for major planets (Mars, Saturn) derived from the Swiss Ephemeris.

We do not presuppose the physical mechanism but treat these as potential exogenous regressors in an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) framework.

# Data & Methodology

## Data Preprocessing
We utilized the USGS Comprehensive Earthquake Catalog (ComCat), filtering for events with $Magnitude \ge 5.0$ from 1900 to 2023. Key preprocessing steps included:
-   **Magnitude Homogenization:** Converting all magnitudes to Moment Magnitude ($M_w$) to ensure consistency.
-   **Declustering:** Applying the Gardner-Knopoff algorithm to remove aftershocks, isolating independent mainshocks.

## Statistical Framework: Negative Binomial Regression
Earthquake counts are discrete, non-negative integers. Traditional OLS regression is inappropriate. We employ a **Generalized Linear Model (GLM)**. Because earthquake counts exhibit overdispersion ($Variance > Mean$) due to clustering, we utilize the Negative Binomial distribution rather than the Poisson distribution.

The model specification is:
$$ \ln(\mu_t) = \beta_0 + \beta_{trend} t + \beta_{season} \sin(\frac{2\pi t}{365}) + \beta_{astro} X_{astro} $$

## The Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)
The Null Hypothesis states that earthquake occurrence is a random Poisson process influenced only by:
-   Long-term catalog detection improvement (Trend).
-   Seasonal tidal stress (Annual Seasonality).
-   Random noise.

Any significant deviation in $\beta_{astro}$ would suggest a signal.

# Results

## Regression Analysis
Table 1 presents the estimated coefficients from the GLM.

## Temporal Prediction
Figure 1 below illustrates the model's ability to track the aggregate monthly seismic rate. The "Prediction Gap" is visible where the model captures the trend but misses extreme outliers (Mega-Quakes).

## "Look-Elsewhere" Analysis
To ensure any detected signal is not a result of p-hacking (finding a pattern by checking thousands of combinations), we performed a Monte Carlo Shuffle Test (N=1000). We destroyed the time-link between astrology and earthquakes while preserving the internal structure of both series.

# Discussion

## Interpretation
The coefficient for **Mars Strength** shows a non-significant negative correlation ($p=0.10$), suggesting that the signal is indistinguishable from noise in this dataset. Similarly, the **Universal Day Number** variables (including Day 8) did not reach the threshold of statistical significance ($p > 0.05$). The **Year Index** also showed no significant trend ($p=0.86$), indicating the seismic rate in the filtered dataset is relatively stable over time or the variance is too high to detect a trend.

## Confounders
Potential confounders include:
-   **Solar Cycle:** The 11-year solar maximum cycle may overlap with planetary periods (Jupiter).
-   **Tidal Stress:** Lunar phases (syzygy) are known physical triggers but are often conflated with "astrology."

## Critical Self-Assessment
The Monte Carlo analysis (Figure 2) reveals that the improvement in model fit (Delta-AIC) provided by the Astro-Fusion variables falls within the 95% confidence interval of random noise. Therefore, strictly speaking, **we fail to reject the Null Hypothesis** for the global dataset. The signal provided by these variables is not strong enough to be used as a standalone predictor for global seismicity.

# Conclusion
This study provides a reproducible computational framework for testing "fringe" scientific hypotheses. While we found anecdotal correlations in individual high-magnitude events, the aggregate statistical analysis suggests that "Universal Day Numbers" and "Global Planetary Strength" do not possess significant predictive power for global earthquake rates. Future work should focus on regionalized hypotheses (Koorma Chakra) rather than global aggregates.
