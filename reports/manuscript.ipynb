        "  **Abstract.** The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) posits that asset prices reflect all available information, rendering them unpredictable through historical data. Conversely, \"Financial Astrology\" claims that deterministic planetary cycles influence market psychology and price action. This study applies rigorous econometric signal processing—including Augmented Dickey-Fuller stationarity tests, Lomb-Scargle spectral analysis, and Vector Autoregression (VAR) with Bonferroni-corrected Granger Causality tests—to falsify the hypothesis that planetary positions provide unique information gain for forecasting XAU/USD (Gold) spot prices. Analyzing 25 years of daily market data against high-precision geocentric ephemerides, we demonstrate that apparent correlations fail to exceed the threshold of statistical significance when adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing. These findings reinforce the EMH and characterize perceived astrological influence as apophenia.\n",

        "The transformation of raw environmental data into actionable economic intelligence is a cornerstone of modern quantitative finance. While macroeconomic indicators (inflation, interest rates) are well-studied, the statistical validity of alternative cyclic predictors, such as astronomical phenomena, remains a subject of contentious debate. This tension—between the *process of discovery* in data science and the *product of rigor* in scientific reporting—necessitates a robust methodological framework for evaluation.\n",

        "This study applies high-dimensional spectral analysis and Granger causality tests to falsify the hypothesis that planetary orbital mechanics influence XAU/USD spot prices. By treating \"Financial Astrology\" not as a mystic art but as a testable signal processing claim, we subject it to \"Severe Testing\" criteria: establishing a null hypothesis of zero effect and only rejecting it in the face of overwhelming statistical evidence.\n",

As financial time series are inherently non-stationary, raw prices were transformed into Logarithmic Returns to stabilize variance and approximate continuous compounding:\n",

To align the continuous celestial data with the discrete trading calendar (which excludes weekends and holidays), planetary positions were sampled at 12:00 UTC on valid trading days only (see `src/data/align_astro_data.py`).\n",

The null hypothesis ($H_0$) states that past values of planetary positions do not contain information that significantly reduces the forecast error of Gold returns. To mitigate the \"p-hacking\" risk inherent in testing multiple planets, we applied the **Bonferroni Correction**, adjusting our significance threshold ($\\alpha = 0.05$) by dividing it by the number of independent hypotheses tested.\n",
